  /*
      When defining a Custom Property's name, we use double hyphen(--) in front the name.
      Example:
       --custom-property-name: value;

      What characters can't we use in a Custom Property name?
      Spaces  and full stops are not allowed but we use dushes instead.

      What possible values can we assign to a new Custom Property?
      We can use keywords, numbers, and even colur names.

      When is it useful to create Custom Properties using the :root or html selector? When is it not? Hint: scope
      It is useful when we want apply values to the all element selectors in the html.
      We do not use it if we want differents.

      After we've defined a new Custom Property, how can we recall or use that Custom Property? What function do we use?
      We use the var() function.

      There are several ways to override or change a Custom Property. Can you name at least 3?
      -We can change the value of a custom property inside a media query, with a pseudo selector like hover.
      -We can still use the same propety but with aother value.
      -We also can use pseudo selector to define the specific element to take the latest value.
      -We can change it directly.

      Why are Custom Properties useful?
      -It keeps our code clean and DRY, also it is easier to make any changes by modifiying only one property. That means there is only one point of  control.
      -It strengthens our code.

      What is the only aspect (or part) of CSS syntax that we can use Custom Properties for?
      It is the declaration blog.
