/*
1-- box-shadow and text-shadow have very similar value syntax. Where do they differ?
They are diffrent when we use the inset keyword value, that means this value does not work with text-shadow. The text-shadow doesn't have thickness.

2--If I wanted to create a hard-edge shadow, one that looks like a solid border, what combination of values would I need to use?
values: x y offset(blur) spread-radious(thikness);


3--Is it possible to create a shadow on a circular element? What about a polygon?
It is not possible because the shadow always follows the edge of the square.
I think we can use a shadow with polygon by appliying the property to both tab and main boxes, then cut off the overlap with clip.

4--Is it possible to create multiple shadows on the same element?
Yes, it is possible. We only need to use a comma to separate each combination of values.
