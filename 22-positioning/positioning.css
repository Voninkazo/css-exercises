Positioning is a layout-breaking form of layout. i.e. it pulls elements out of the normal flow, and one has to use known dimensions to account for these positioned elements.

First up though, what is the default value for position?
The position property is set by the default value `static`.

What are some of the other properties you need to supply when using any non-default position value?
These are the properties:display and line-height.

What is the inferred display value of an element that has been positioned?

One of the non-default values for position still maintains a box in the flow of the document. Which one is it?

What is special or significant about fixed and sticky positioning?
position: sticky basically acts like position: relative until an element is scrolled beyond a specific offset, in which case it turns into position: fixed, causing the element to "stick" to its position instead of being scrolled out of view.
When positioning an element absolutely, how can we lock that element's coordinates to its parent element?

What are absolute positioned layouts useful for?
To combine two separate images in one perfect scene.
It helps you when you use badges in desings to demonstrate attributes that the product or service has.

Sometimes if you put two absolutely positioned elements in the same physical space, they'll stack, i.e. only one will be visible on top. What are the rules here? Why is a certain element on top? How can we adjust that ourselves?

What is CSS's 'Stacking Context'?
The stacking context is a three-dimensional conceptualization of HTML elements along an imaginary z-axis relative to the user, who is assumed to be facing the viewport or the webpage. HTML elements occupy this space in priority order based on element attributes.
