  /*
  Counters
  Some generated content can include counters.
  How do we count in CSS - i.e. what declaration do we use?
  To use a CSS counter, it must first be initialized to a value with the counter-reset property (0 by default). The same property can also be used to change its value to any specific number. Once initialized, a counter's value can be increased or decreased with counter-increment. The counter's name must not be "none", "inherit", or "initial"; otherwise the declaration is ignored.

  How do we reset a counter?
  To reset a counter, we have to use a `counter-reset` property. There are three types of keyword values that can be with this property: none, negative values like -5, positive values like -5.

  What are counters useful for?
  We can use counters to count how many times some valuse are used.
  It is also used to number the headings in webpages.
